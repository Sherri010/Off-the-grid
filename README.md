#PACMAN:

###How the game works:
There are two players in this game, one is the user(pacman) and other is being conrolled by JavaScript(ghost). The goal is to travel through the maze and hit every open cell atleast once. once pacman covers the whole maze the game is over. If the the ghost catches pacman, you loose the game. 

###How to play:
you can use arrow keys to navigate through the maze. blue blocks are blocked.
After the game is over, you can click on reset to start a new game.

##Development:
This is a simpler version of PACMAN developed using:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - jQuery









###RoadMap:
1. developing small grid using js
2. initializing pacman on the grid
3. add movement to pacman
4. extend the grid and add css and images
5. add ghoast and use .rand to generate next movement
6. completing the logic of the game 
7. adding reset option



###future steps:
1. have multiple ghosts
2. options to select maze 
3. add lives to pacman in each game
